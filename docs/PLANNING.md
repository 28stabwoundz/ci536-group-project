## ðŸ“Ž Integration Points

- All features use RESTful APIs.
- Frontend consumes only documented endpoints (see `API_CONTRACTS.md`)
- Resume parsing reads uploaded CVs from cloud URLs.
- Admin dashboard is read-only for security.

## ðŸš« Out of Scope

- Real-time features (chat, notifications)
- In-app messaging
- Complex ML-based scoring
- Native mobile apps

## ðŸ“Œ Dev Guidelines

- One feature per developer
- PRs merge into `develop` branch
- Use mock APIs for frontend if backend isn't ready
- Docs: Keep `TASK.md` and `README.md` updated
